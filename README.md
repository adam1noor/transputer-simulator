# transputer-simulator
A simulator of the Transputer by Inmos


I made this simulator as part of my 3rd year project in my Computer Science degree. The simulator as provided is fully operational but unfinished in terms of instructions implemented. It's designed to be straightforward to add new instructions however.

To use the simulator create a text file, write the code you wish to execute and change the extension of that file to .tn . Then open a shell in the directory containing the simulator and type 

>./python3 Interpreter.py filename.tn

Alternatively a RÂ£PL is available by typing

>./python3 Interpreter.py
